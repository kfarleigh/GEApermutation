This repository will contain code to perform a statistical test to identify differential patterns of local adpatation. The paper has recently been accepted (8/31/23) and I will be uploading the code shortly. Feel free to reach out (farleik@miamioh.edu) if you have any questions or think that this may be applicable to your research.
